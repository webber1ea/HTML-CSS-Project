# HTML-CSS-Project

For this project, I decided to use basic CSS and bootstrap for styling.
To generate a new row containing the user input I used JavaScript/jQuery.
Unforunately, I was unable to figure out a way to store the user's input into the URL to send the user to the landing page with a customized greeting. I spend hours pouring over Google, Youtube, and Stack Overflow trying to figure out a way to do so, but did not find a way that fit.
This solution focuses on front-end. I chose to use bootstrap because I believe that structure of it creates an appealing and neat look.
