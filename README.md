# HTML-CSS-Project

For this project, I decided to use basic CSS and bootstrap for styling.
To generate a new row containing the user input I used JavaScript/jQuery.
The user is able to input a value into the form, click Add and the input will be sent through an addRow() function that will display the input on the bottom line of the row. If the user would like to delete a previously entered input, they are able to.
Unforunately, I was unable to figure out a way to store the user's input into the URL to send the user to the landing page with a customized greeting. I spend hours pouring over Google, Youtube, and Stack Overflow trying to figure out a way to do so, but did not find a way that fit.
This solution focuses on front-end. I chose to use bootstrap because I believe that structure of it creates an appealing and neat look.
